# Unplug

Unplug is a work in progress experiment to make VST3 plugins using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and [Pugl](https://github.com/lv2/pugl) and [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) instead of VSTGUI to do the user interface.

Currently, it *seems* to work on Windows and Mac. It still needs some work on Linux. 

## Installing dependencies on Ubuntu

```bash
$ sudo apt install libx11-dev
$ sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
$ sudo apt install libxrandr-dev
$ sudo apt install libxcursor-dev
```
